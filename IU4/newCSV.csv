18;1;;Where the White House doors used to be closed, they are now wide open – open for the People’s Business. But, most importantly, we are translating these meetings into action. One by one, we are checking off the promises we made to the people of the United States. And we will not stop until the job is done. ✔️We will reduce taxes. ✔️We will cut regulations. ✔️We will support our police. ✔️We will defend our flag. ✔️We will rebuild our military. ✔️We will take care of our Veterans. ✔️We will fix our trade deals. ✔️We will cut wasteful spending. ✔️We will promote our values. ✔️We will rebuild our inner cities. ✔️And we will bring back our jobs and our dreams. The forgotten men and women of America will be forgotten no longer. That is the heart of this new movement – and the future of the Republican Party. The GOP will be the party of the American Worker. We will not answer to donors or lobbyists or special interests – but we will serve the citizens of the United States of America. Global cooperation is important.  But there is no such thing as a global anthem, a global currency, or a global flag. There is one allegiance that unites us all, and that is our allegiance to America. No matter our background, or income, or geography – we are all citizens of this blessed land. And no matter our color, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots. We all salute the same American Flag. And we are all made equal by the same Almighty God. As long as we have faith in each other, and trust in God, then there is no goal beyond our reach. There is no dream too large, no task too great. We are Americans.  And the future belongs to us. The future belongs to all of you. And America is about to come roaring back – Bigger and Better and Stronger than ever before. Thank you, God Bless You, and God Bless the United States of America.;status;25712;17-02-01
19;1;;We inherited a national debt that has doubled in eight years. We inherited a foreign policy marked by one disaster after another. But we are taking firm, bold and decisive measures to turn it all around. The era of empty talk is over. Now is the time for action. So let me tell you about the actions we are taking right now to deliver on our promises to the American People.;status;3849;17-02-01
20;1;Timeline Photos;We are also putting in a massive budget request for the military, and we will be substantially upgrading all of our defenses. It will be one of the greatest military buildups in American history. No one will dare to question our military might. We believe in Peace Through Strength. As part of my pledge to restore safety for the American People, I have also directed the Defense Community to develop a plan to destroy ISIS. Working with our allies, we will eradicate this evil from the face of the Earth. At the same time, we understand that national security begins with border security.  Foreign terrorists will not be able to strike America if they cannot get into America. So let me state this as clearly as I can: we are going to keep Radical Islamic Terrorists out of our country. We will not be deterred from this course. And, in a matter of days, we will be taking brand new action to protect our people and keep America Safe. I will never, ever apologize for protecting the safety and security of the American People.;photo;7231;17-02-01
21;1;;We are going to massively lower taxes on the middle class, reduce taxes on American business, and make our tax code more simple and fair for everyone. In anticipation of these and other changes, jobs are already starting to pour back into our country.  Ford, Fiat Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Intel and so many others are making major investments in the United States – expanding production, hiring more workers. It is time to get Americans off of welfare and back to work.;status;21539;17-02-01

We are all part of this historic movement – a movement the likes of which the world has never seen before!;photo;2275;17-02-01

177;1;;Statement by the National Security Advisor Recent Iranian actions, including a provocative ballistic missile launch and an attack against a Saudi naval vessel conducted by Iran-supported Houthi militants, underscore what should have been clear to the international community all along about Iran’s destabilizing behavior across the Middle East. The recent ballistic missile launch is also in defiance of UN Security Council Resolution 2231, which calls upon Iran “not to undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons, including launches using such ballistic missile technology. These are just the latest of a series of incidents in the past six months in which Houthi forces that Iran has trained and armed have struck Emirati and Saudi vessels, and threatened U.S. and allied vessels transiting the Red Sea.  In these and other similar activities, Iran continues to threaten U.S. friends and allies in the region. The Obama Administration failed to respond adequately to Tehran’s malign actions—including weapons transfers, support for terrorism, and other violations of international norms.  The Trump Administration condemns such actions by Iran that undermine security, prosperity, and stability throughout and beyond the Middle East and place American lives at risk. President Trump has severely criticized the various agreements reached between Iran and the Obama Administration, as well as the United Nations – as being weak and ineffective. Instead of being thankful to the United States for these agreements, Iran is now feeling emboldened.  As of today, we are officially putting Iran on notice.;status;18778;17-02-01

182;1;Timeline Photos;President Donald J. Trump Nominates Judge Neil Gorsuch to the United States Supreme Court Today, President Donald J. Trump nominated Judge Neil Gorsuch of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit to fill the Supreme Court vacancy created by the passing of Justice Antonin Scalia. The nomination of Judge Gorsuch comes after a selection process marked by an unprecedented level of transparency and involvement by the American voters. “I am proud to announce the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch for Justice of the Supreme Court,” President Trump said. “This has been the most transparent and most important Supreme Court selection process in the history of our country and I wanted the American people to have a voice in this nomination. Judge Gorsuch has a superb intellect, an unparalleled legal education, and a commitment to interpreting the Constitution according to its text. He will make an incredible Justice as soon as the Senate confirms him.” Judge Gorsuch was born and raised in Colorado. He attended Columbia University and Harvard Law School. After graduating with honors, he received his doctorate from Oxford University as a Marshall Scholar. Judge Gorsuch clerked for Judge David Sentelle of the D.C. Circuit and both Justices Byron White and Anthony Kennedy on the Supreme Court. Following a successful career in private practice, Judge Gorsuch joined the Department of Justice as the Principal Deputy Associate Attorney General. In 2006, President George W. Bush nominated him for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, and he was confirmed by voice vote without objection. He has served with distinction, earning a reputation as a brilliant jurist with an outstanding intellect and a clear, incisive writing style, and he is universally respected for his integrity and fairness to all parties. “I am honored and humbled to receive this nomination,” said Judge Gorsuch. “I look forward to meeting with Senators over the coming weeks as we begin this process.”;photo;4003;17-02-01

189;1;;PRESIDENT TRUMP WORKS TO MAKE DRUGS MORE AFFORDABLE, CREATE JOBS Highlights From The President’s Listening Session With Pharmaceutical Industry Leaders- PRESIDENT TRUMP: “You folks have done a terrific job over the years, but we have to get prices down for a lot of reasons. We have no choice. For Medicare, for Medicaid, we have to get the prices way down, so that's what we're going to be talking about. We're also going to be streamlining the process so that from your standpoint when you have drug you can actually get it approved, if it works instead of waiting for many, many years. The U.S. drug companies have produced extraordinary results for our country but the pricing has been astronomical for our country.” President Trump Focused On Cutting Regulations To Encourage Drug Companies To Bring Back Operations And Jobs To The United States PRESIDENT TRUMP: “So you have to get your companies back here. We have to make progress back. We're going to get rid of a tremendous number of regulations. I know you have some problems where you cannot even think about opening up new plants and then you can't get approval for the plant and then you can't get approval to make the drug.” President Trump On Appointing A Leader To Streamline The FDA To Reduce Prices And Get New Products On The Market Faster: PRESIDENT TRUMP: “We’re going to streamline the FDA, we have a fantastic person that I think I we’ll be naming fairly soon, he's going to streamline the FDA and you're going to get your products either approved or not approved but it's going to be a quick process. It’s not going to take 15 years. And we're going to do I think a tremendous -- I think we're going to make a tremendous difference to you. I read where it costs sometimes $2.5 billion on average, actually, to come up with a new product. Is that correct? 15 years, $2.5 billion to come up with a product where there's not even a safety problem. So it's crazy. I’m surprised you can't get them to move faster than that.”;status;8578;17-01-01
190;1;Timeline Photos;Today I met with pharmaceutical executives at the White House.  US drug companies have produced extraordinary results for our country, but the pricing has been astronomical for our country. We have to do better. We have to get lower prices, we have to get even better innovation. I expressed to the executives that I want them to move their companies back to the United States -- and I want them to manufacture in the United States. Our trade policy will prioritize that foreign countries pay their fair share for U.S.-manufactured drugs, so our drug companies have greater financial resources to accelerate development of new cures -- I think that’s so important! Right now it’s very unfair what other countries are doing to us - and in order to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN -- we all need to work together right here in the United States of America.;photo;32622;17-01-01

193;1;;Statement on the Appointment of Dana Boente as Acting Attorney General The acting Attorney General, Sally Yates, has betrayed the Department of Justice by refusing to enforce a legal order designed to protect the citizens of the United States. This order was approved as to form and legality by the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel. Ms. Yates is an Obama Administration appointee who is weak on borders and very weak on illegal immigration. It is time to get serious about protecting our country. Calling for tougher vetting for individuals travelling from seven dangerous places is not extreme. It is reasonable and necessary to protect our country. Tonight, President Trump relieved Ms. Yates of her duties and subsequently named Dana Boente, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, to serve as Acting Attorney General until Senator Jeff Sessions is finally confirmed by the Senate, where he is being wrongly held up by Democrat senators for strictly political reasons. “I am honored to serve President Trump in this role until Senator Sessions is confirmed.

199;1;;Statement Regarding Recent Executive Order Concerning Extreme Vetting “America is a proud nation of immigrants and we will continue to show compassion to those fleeing oppression, but we will do so while protecting our own citizens and border. America has always been the land of the free and home of the brave. We will keep it free and keep it safe, as the media knows, but refuses to say. My policy is similar to what President Obama did in 2011 when he banned visas for refugees from Iraq for six months. The seven countries named in the Executive Order are the same countries previously identified by the Obama administration as sources of terror. To be clear, this is not a Muslim ban, as the media is falsely reporting. This is not about religion - this is about terror and keeping our country safe. There are over 40 different countries worldwide that are majority Muslim that are not affected by this order. We will again be issuing visas to all countries once we are sure we have reviewed and implemented the most secure policies over the next 90 days. I have tremendous feeling for the people involved in this horrific humanitarian crisis in Syria. My first priority will always be to protect and serve our country, but as President I will find ways to help all those who are suffering.”;status;269567;17-01-01

Both leaders affirmed the importance of close German-American cooperation to our countries' security and prosperity and expressed their desire to deepen already close German-American relations in the coming years.  The President and Chancellor also agreed on the NATO Alliance's fundamental importance to the broader transatlantic relationship and its role in ensuring the peace and stability of our North Atlantic community.  In this vein, the leaders recognized that NATO must be capable of confronting 21st century threats and that our common defense requires appropriate investment in military capabilities to ensure all Allies are contributing their fair share to our collective security.  The leaders agreed on the need to strengthen already robust cooperation in the fight against terrorism and violent extremism, and to work to stabilize conflict areas in the Middle East and North Africa.

315;1;;Today our nation pauses to honor a legend, an icon, and an American hero. The Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. lifted up the conscience of our nation -- a towering leader in his day, and a lasting inspiration for all generations to follow. Our Declaration declares that 'all men are created equal,' and Dr. King challenged our nation to live out that sacred truth: to banish the evils of bigotry, segregation and oppression from the  institutions of society and the hearts of men. His legacy of freedom is the true memorial to his life: no testimonial can pay better tribute than the faces of young children living out their dreams. But his work is not done: all around us today we see communities and schools falling behind and not sharing in the prosperity of American life. Each of us has a solemn obligation to ensure that no American is left behind -- and that all Americans are fully included in the American Dream. When young Americans of color are left on the sidelines, our nation is denied a lifetime of contributions to this society -- and when any of our American brothers and sisters is forced to live in fear, or poverty, or violence, it is setback for the entire nation. We rise and fall together, and today we pledge to follow in Dr. King's footsteps so that all Americans may know the full blessings of this God-blessed land.;status;53099;17-01-01

330;1;Timeline Photos;President-Elect Trump Announces Former Mayor Rudolph Giuliani to Lend Expertise to Cyber Security Efforts (New York, NY) — President-elect Trump is very pleased to announce former Mayor Rudy Giuliani will be sharing his expertise and insight as a trusted friend concerning private sector cyber security problems and emerging solutions developing in the private sector. This is a rapidly evolving field both as to intrusions and solutions and it is critically important to get timely information from all sources. In addition, from time to time because of the changing nature of this problem, it is contemplated that the President-elect will be hosting a series of meetings with senior corporate executives from companies which have faced or are facing challenges similar to those facing the government and public entities today, such as hacking, intrusions, disruptions, manipulations, theft of data and identities, and securing information technology infrastructure. The President-elect’s intent is to obtain experiential and anecdotal information from each executive on challenges faced by his/her company, how the company met the challenges, approaches which were productive or successful, and those which were not. The attendees may or may not change from session to session, but the specific agenda subjects will likely change because of the rapidly evolving field of cyber security, and frequent developments, both positive and negative. No consensus advice or recommendations resulting from group deliberations or interaction is expected or will be solicited. Cyber intrusion is the fastest growing crime in the United States and much of the world. Its impact is felt from the individual citizen whose identity is stolen to the large private and government entities that have seen their confidential information seriously compromised. It is also a major threat to our national security. As the use of modern communications and technology has moved forward at unparalleled speed the necessary defenses have lagged behind. The President-elect recognizes that this needs immediate attention and input from private sector leaders to help the government plan to make us more secure. Mr. Giuliani was asked to initiate this process because of his long and very successful government career in law enforcement and his now sixteen years of work providing security solutions in the private sector. Mr. Giuliani is the chairman of the global cyber security practice at Greenberg Traurig and the Chairman and CEO of Giuliani Partners, an international security consulting firm.;photo;4754;17-01-01

As the current Undersecretary for Health at the Department of Veterans Affairs, Dr. Shulkin leads the nation's largest integrated healthcare system, currently serving 8.76 million veterans every year at over 1,700 locations. Dr. Shulkin has exemplified strong leadership in this position and in various other roles throughout his career, including as a chief executive and a doctor in academia and leader in entrepreneurial roles. “I have no doubt Dr. Shulkin will be able to lead the turnaround our Department of Veterans Affairs needs. His sole mandate will be to serve our veterans and restore the level of care we owe to our brave men and women in the military,” said President-elect Donald J. Trump. “Sadly our great veterans have not gotten the level of care they deserve, but Dr. Shulkin has the experience and the vision to ensure we will meet the healthcare needs of every veteran. Dr. Shulkin is an incredibly gifted doctor who is using his elite talents for medicine to care for our heroes, and Americans can have faith he will get the job done right.” “It is my honor to serve as President-elect Trump’s Secretary of Veterans Affairs,” said Dr. David Shulkin. """"President-elect Trump's commitment to caring for our veterans is unquestionable, and he is eager to support the best practices for care and provide our Veterans Affairs’ teams with the resources they need to improve health outcomes. We are both eager to begin reforming the areas in our Veterans Affairs system that need critical attention, and do it in a swift, thoughtful and responsible way.” Before serving as Under Secretary for Health, Dr. Shulkin served in numerous chief executive roles including serving as President at Morristown Medical Center, Goryeb Children’s Hospital, and Atlantic Rehabilitation Institute, and the Atlantic Health System Accountable Care Organization. Dr. Shulkin also previously served as President and CEO of Beth Israel Medical Center in New York City. Dr. Shulkin has held numerous physician leadership roles including the Chief Medical Officer of the University of Pennsylvania Health System, the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Temple University Hospital, and the Medical College of Pennsylvania Hospital. Dr. Shulkin has also held academic positions including the Chairman of Medicine and Vice Dean at Drexel University School of Medicine. As an entrepreneur, Dr. Shulkin founded and served as the Chairman and CEO of DoctorQuality one of the first consumer-oriented sources of information for quality and safety in healthcare. Dr. Shulkin is a board-certified internist, a fellow of the American College of Physicians.

Massive increases of ObamaCare will take place this year and Dems are to blame for the mess. It will fall of its own weight - be careful! -DJT;status;8963;17-01-01

476;1;;On November 8th, EVERYTHING changes. Our movement is about replacing a failed and corrupt political establishment with a new government controlled by you, the American people. The establishment has trillions of dollars at stake in this election. For those who control the levers of power in Washington and for the global special interests, they partner with these people that don’t have your good in mind. The political establishment that is trying to stop us is the same group responsible for our disastrous trade deals, massive illegal immigration and economic and foreign policies that have bled our country dry. The political establishment has brought about the destruction of our factories and our jobs as they flee to Mexico, China and other countries all around the world. It’s a global power structure that is responsible for the economic decisions that have robbed our working class, stripped our country of its wealth and put that money into the pockets of a handful of large corporations and political entities. The only thing that can stop this corrupt machine is you. The only force strong enough to save our country is us. The only people brave enough to vote out this corrupt establishment is you, the American people. I’m doing this for the people and the movement and we will take back this country for you and we will Make America Great Again.;video;49213;16-11-01

597;1;;Here is my statement. I’ve never said I’m a perfect person, nor pretended to be someone that I’m not.  I’ve said and done things I regret, and the words released today on this more than a decade-old video are one of them.  Anyone who knows me, know these words don’t reflect who I am. I said it, it was wrong, and I apologize. I’ve travelled the country talking about change for America. But my travels have also changed me.  I’ve spent time with grieving mothers who’ve lost their children, laid off workers whose jobs have gone to other countries, and people from all walks of life who just want a better future. I have gotten to know the great people of our country, and I’ve been humbled by the faith they’ve placed in me. I pledge to be a better man tomorrow, and will never, ever let you down. Let’s be honest.  We’re living in the real world.  This is nothing more than a distraction from the important issues we are facing today.  We are losing our jobs, we are less safe than we were 8 years ago and Washington is broken. Hillary Clinton, and her kind, have run our country into the ground. I’ve said some foolish things, but there is a big difference between words and actions. Bill Clinton has actually abused women and Hillary has bullied, attacked, shamed and intimidated his victims. We will discuss this more in the coming days. See you at the debate on Sunday.;video;377565;16-10-01

934;1;Timeline Photos;THANK YOU SENATOR Jeff Sessions! DONALD J. TRUMP ENDORSED BY SENATOR JEFF SESSIONS stars Senator Sessions Joined Mr. Trump in Madison, Alabama to Endorse the Republican Frontrunner (New York, NY) February 28th, 2016 – Today Donald J. Trump received the endorsement of Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions. Senator Sessions is widely recognized as the nation's most highly respected official on the issue of illegal immigration.  Mr. Trump stated, “I am deeply honored to have the endorsement of Senator Jeff Sessions, leader of congressional conservatives. He has been called the Senate's indispensable man and the gold standard. He led the fight against the Gang of Eight, against Obama's trade deal, against Obama's judges, and for American sovereignty. He has stood up to special interests as few have. There is no more respected man in Congress and we are closely aligned on many issues, including trade and illegal immigration, and I am proud to consider Jeff Sessions an advisor, friend and ally.”  Mr. Trump and Senator Sessions surprised the massive crowd at the frontrunner’s Alabama rally just days before Super Tuesday Primary contest. Senator Sessions added, “I am thrilled today to offer my endorsement of Donald J. Trump for President. This election is our last chance to save U.S. sovereignty and to end the domination of the political establishment over the interests of working Americans. Trump alone has rejected the donor class, defending America’s jobs and wages from open borders, uncontrolled immigration and the massive Trans-Pacific Partnership that will cede U.S. authority to foreign powers. Trump’s trade and immigration plans will revitalize our shrinking middle class, keeping jobs and wealth and income inside the United States of America. Trump understands that a nation must always place the interests of its own people first.” Senator Sessions continued, “We are nearing fast the point of no return. The people are hurting. Their wages are declining. Their schools are overburdened. Their hospitals are stretched past the breaking point. Crime is up, and community confidence is down. Americans of all backgrounds and ethnicities, immigrant and US-born, are crying out for leadership that puts their needs first, that takes care of those living and dreaming here today, leadership that understands that there is no constituency other than the American constituency. Mr. Trump is that leader. We are witnessing an incredible movement, arising from the people.  The events of history have aligned to give the people this fleeting chance to bust up the oligarchy – to take back control from the ‘Masters of the Universe’ return it to the good and decent and patriotic citizens of the United States.”;photo;6732;16-02-01

1084;1;;Where the White House doors used to be closed, they are now wide open – open for the People’s Business. But, most importantly, we are translating these meetings into action.  One by one, we are checking off the promises we made to the people of the United States. And we will not stop until the job is done. ✔️We will reduce taxes. ️We will cut regulations. ✔️We will support our police. ✔️We will defend our flag. ✔️We will rebuild our military. ✔️We will take care of our Veterans. ✔️We will fix our trade deals. ✔️We will cut wasteful spending. ✔️We will promote our values. ✔️We will rebuild our inner cities. ✔️And we will bring back our jobs and our dreams. The forgotten men and women of America will be forgotten no longer. That is the heart of this new movement – and the future of the Republican Party.   The GOP will be the party of the American Worker. We will not answer to donors or lobbyists or special interests – but we will serve the citizens of the United States of America. Global cooperation is important.  But there is no such thing as a global anthem, a global currency, or a global flag. There is one allegiance that unites us all, and that is our allegiance to America. No matter our background, or income, or geography – we are all citizens of this blessed land. And no matter our color, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots. We all salute the same American Flag. And we are all made equal by the same Almighty God. As long as we have faith in each other, and trust in God, then there is no goal beyond our reach. There is no dream too large, no task too great. We are Americans.  And the future belongs to us. The future belongs to all of you. And America is about to come roaring back – Bigger and Better and Stronger than ever before. Thank you, God Bless You, and God Bless the United States of America.;status;25912;17-02-01
1085;1;;We inherited a national debt that has doubled in eight years. We inherited a foreign policy marked by one disaster after another. But we are taking firm, bold and decisive measures to turn it all around. The era of empty talk is over. Now is the time for action. So let me tell you about the actions we are taking right now to deliver on our promises to the American People.;status;3883;17-02-01
1086;1;Timeline Photos;We are also putting in a massive budget request for the military, and we will be substantially upgrading all of our defenses. It will be one of the greatest military buildups in American history. No one will dare to question our military might. We believe in Peace Through Strength.  As part of my pledge to restore safety for the American People, I have also directed the Defense Community to develop a plan to destroy ISIS. Working with our allies, we will eradicate this evil from the face of the Earth. At the same time, we understand that national security begins with border security.  Foreign terrorists will not be able to strike America if they cannot get into America. So let me state this as clearly as I can: we are going to keep Radical Islamic Terrorists out of our country. We will not be deterred from this course. And, in a matter of days, we will be taking brand new action to protect our people and keep America Safe.  I will never, ever apologize for protecting the safety and security of the American People.;photo;7295;17-02-01
1087;1;;We are going to massively lower taxes on the middle class, reduce taxes on American business, and make our tax code more simple and fair for everyone. In anticipation of these and other changes, jobs are already starting to pour back into our country.  Ford, Fiat Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Intel and so many others are making major investments in the United States – expanding production, hiring more workers. It is time to get Americans off of welfare and back to work.;status;21680;17-02-01

1089;1;Timeline Photos;Our victory was a win for every hardworking citizen in this country who believes in freedom, security and the rule of law. Our victory was a win for conservative values. And our victory was a win for everyone who believes it is time to stand up for America, to stand up for the American Worker, and to stand up for the American Flag. We are all part of this historic movement – a movement the likes of which the world has never seen before!;photo;2309;17-02-01

1243;1;;Statement by the National Security Advisor Recent Iranian actions, including a provocative ballistic missile launch and an attack against a Saudi naval vessel conducted by Iran-supported Houthi militants, underscore what should have been clear to the international community all along about Iran’s destabilizing behavior across the Middle East. The recent ballistic missile launch is also in defiance of UN Security Council Resolution 2231, which calls upon Iran “not to undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons, including launches using such ballistic missile technology. These are just the latest of a series of incidents in the past six months in which Houthi forces that Iran has trained and armed have struck Emirati and Saudi vessels, and threatened U.S. and allied vessels transiting the Red Sea.  In these and other similar activities, Iran continues to threaten U.S. friends and allies in the region. The Obama Administration failed to respond adequately to Tehran’s malign actions—including weapons transfers, support for terrorism, and other violations of international norms.  The Trump Administration condemns such actions by Iran that undermine security, prosperity, and stability throughout and beyond the Middle East and place American lives at risk. President Trump has severely criticized the various agreements reached between Iran and the Obama Administration, as well as the United Nations – as being weak and ineffective. Instead of being thankful to the United States for these agreements, Iran is now feeling emboldened. As of today, we are officially putting Iran on notice.;status;18764;17-02-01

1248;1;Timeline Photos;President Donald J. Trump Nominates Judge Neil Gorsuch to the United States Supreme Court Today, President Donald J. Trump nominated Judge Neil Gorsuch of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit to fill the Supreme Court vacancy created by the passing of Justice Antonin Scalia. The nomination of Judge Gorsuch comes after a selection process marked by an unprecedented level of transparency and involvement by the American voters. “I am proud to announce the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch for Justice of the Supreme Court,” President Trump said. “This has been the most transparent and most important Supreme Court selection process in the history of our country and I wanted the American people to have a voice in this nomination. Judge Gorsuch has a superb intellect, an unparalleled legal education, and a commitment to interpreting the Constitution according to its text. He will make an incredible Justice as soon as the Senate confirms him.” Judge Gorsuch was born and raised in Colorado. He attended Columbia University and Harvard Law School. After graduating with honors, he received his doctorate from Oxford University as a Marshall Scholar. Judge Gorsuch clerked for Judge David Sentelle of the D.C. Circuit and both Justices Byron White and Anthony Kennedy on the Supreme Court. Following a successful career in private practice, Judge Gorsuch joined the Department of Justice as the Principal Deputy Associate Attorney General. In 2006, President George W. Bush nominated him for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, and he was confirmed by voice vote without objection. He has served with distinction, earning a reputation as a brilliant jurist with an outstanding intellect and a clear, incisive writing style, and he is universally respected for his integrity and fairness to all parties. “I am honored and humbled to receive this nomination,” said Judge Gorsuch. “I look forward to meeting with Senators over the coming weeks as we begin this process.”;photo;4009;17-02-01

1255;1;;PRESIDENT TRUMP WORKS TO MAKE DRUGS MORE AFFORDABLE, CREATE JOBS Highlights From The President’s Listening Session With Pharmaceutical Industry Leaders- PRESIDENT TRUMP: “You folks have done a terrific job over the years, but we have to get prices down for a lot of reasons. We have no choice. For Medicare, for Medicaid, we have to get the prices way down, so that's what we're going to be talking about. We're also going to be streamlining the process so that from your standpoint when you have drug you can actually get it approved, if it works instead of waiting for many, many years. The U.S. drug companies have produced extraordinary results for our country but the pricing has been astronomical for our country.” President Trump Focused On Cutting Regulations To Encourage Drug Companies To Bring Back Operations And Jobs To The United States PRESIDENT TRUMP: “So you have to get your companies back here. We have to make progress back. We're going to get rid of a tremendous number of regulations. I know you have some problems where you cannot even think about opening up new plants and then you can't get approval for the plant and then you can't get approval to make the drug.” President Trump On Appointing A Leader To Streamline The FDA To Reduce Prices And Get New Products On The Market Faster: PRESIDENT TRUMP: “We’re going to streamline the FDA, we have a fantastic person that I think I we’ll be naming fairly soon, he's going to streamline the FDA and you're going to get your products either approved or not approved but it's going to be a quick process. It’s not going to take 15 years. And we're going to do I think a tremendous -- I think we're going to make a tremendous difference to you. I read where it costs sometimes $2.5 billion on average, actually, to come up with a new product. Is that correct? 15 years, $2.5 billion to come up with a product where there's not even a safety problem. So it's crazy. I’m surprised you can't get them to move faster than that.”;status;8576;17-01-01
1256;1;Timeline Photos;Today I met with pharmaceutical executives at the White House.  US drug companies have produced extraordinary results for our country, but the pricing has been astronomical for our country. We have to do better. We have to get lower prices, we have to get even better innovation. I expressed to the executives that I want them to move their companies back to the United States -- and I want them to manufacture in the United States. Our trade policy will prioritize that foreign countries pay their fair share for U.S.-manufactured drugs, so our drug companies have greater financial resources to accelerate development of new cures -- I think that’s so important! Right now it’s very unfair what other countries are doing to us - and in order to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN -- we all need to work together right here in the United States of America.;photo;32607;17-01-01

1259;1;;Statement on the Appointment of Dana Boente as Acting Attorney General The acting Attorney General, Sally Yates, has betrayed the Department of Justice by refusing to enforce a legal order designed to protect the citizens of the United States. This order was approved as to form and legality by the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel. Ms. Yates is an Obama Administration appointee who is weak on borders and very weak on illegal immigration. It is time to get serious about protecting our country. Calling for tougher vetting for individuals travelling from seven dangerous places is not extreme. It is reasonable and necessary to protect our country. Tonight, President Trump relieved Ms. Yates of her duties and subsequently named Dana Boente, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, to serve as Acting Attorney General until Senator Jeff Sessions is finally confirmed by the Senate, where he is being wrongly held up by Democrat senators for strictly political reasons. “I am honored to serve President Trump in this role until Senator Sessions is confirmed. I will defend and enforce the laws of our country to ensure that our people and our nation are protected,” said Dana Boente, Acting Attorney General.;status;46110;17-01-01

1265;1;;Statement Regarding Recent Executive Order Concerning Extreme Vetting “America is a proud nation of immigrants and we will continue to show compassion to those fleeing oppression, but we will do so while protecting our own citizens and border. America has always been the land of the free and home of the brave. We will keep it free and keep it safe, as the media knows, but refuses to say. My policy is similar to what President Obama did in 2011 when he banned visas for refugees from Iraq for six months. The seven countries named in the Executive Order are the same countries previously identified by the Obama administration as sources of terror. To be clear, this is not a Muslim ban, as the media is falsely reporting. This is not about religion - this is about terror and keeping our country safe. There are over 40 different countries worldwide that are majority Muslim that are not affected by this order. We will again be issuing visas to all countries once we are sure we have reviewed and implemented the most secure policies over the next 90 days. I have tremendous feeling for the people involved in this horrific humanitarian crisis in Syria. My first priority will always be to protect and serve our country, but as President I will find ways to help all those who are suffering.”;status;269377;17-01-01

Both leaders affirmed the importance of close German-American cooperation to our countries' security and prosperity and expressed their desire to deepen already close German-American relations in the coming years. The President and Chancellor also agreed on the NATO Alliance's fundamental importance to the broader transatlantic relationship and its role in ensuring the peace and stability of our North Atlantic community.  In this vein, the leaders recognized that NATO must be capable of confronting 21st century threats and that our common defense requires appropriate investment in military capabilities to ensure all Allies are contributing their fair share to our collective security. The leaders agreed on the need to strengthen already robust cooperation in the fight against terrorism and violent extremism, and to work to stabilize conflict areas in the Middle East and North Africa.

1381;1;;Today our nation pauses to honor a legend, an icon, and an American hero. The Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. lifted up the conscience of our nation -- a towering leader in his day, and a lasting inspiration for all generations to follow.  Our Declaration declares that 'all men are created equal,' and Dr. King challenged our nation to live out that sacred truth: to banish the evils of bigotry, segregation and oppression from the  institutions of society and the hearts of men. His legacy of freedom is the true memorial to his life: no testimonial can pay better tribute than the faces of young children living out their dreams. But his work is not done: all around us today we see communities and schools falling behind and not sharing in the prosperity of American life. Each of us has a solemn obligation to ensure that no American is left behind -- and that all Americans are fully included in the American Dream. When young Americans of color are left on the sidelines, our nation is denied a lifetime of contributions to this society -- and when any of our American brothers and sisters is forced to live in fear, or poverty, or violence, it is setback for the entire nation.  We rise and fall together, and today we pledge to follow in Dr. King's footsteps so that all Americans may know the full blessings of this God-blessed land.;status;53075;17-01-01

1396;1;Timeline Photos;President-Elect Trump Announces Former Mayor Rudolph Giuliani to Lend Expertise to Cyber Security Efforts (New York, NY) — President-elect Trump is very pleased to announce former Mayor Rudy Giuliani will be sharing his expertise and insight as a trusted friend concerning private sector cyber security problems and emerging solutions developing in the private sector. This is a rapidly evolving field both as to intrusions and solutions and it is critically important to get timely information from all sources. In addition, from time to time because of the changing nature of this problem, it is contemplated that the President-elect will be hosting a series of meetings with senior corporate executives from companies which have faced or are facing challenges similar to those facing the government and public entities today, such as hacking, intrusions, disruptions, manipulations, theft of data and identities, and securing information technology infrastructure. The President-elect’s intent is to obtain experiential and anecdotal information from each executive on challenges faced by his/her company, how the company met the challenges, approaches which were productive or successful, and those which were not. The attendees may or may not change from session to session, but the specific agenda subjects will likely change because of the rapidly evolving field of cyber security, and frequent developments, both positive and negative. No consensus advice or recommendations resulting from group deliberations or interaction is expected or will be solicited. Cyber intrusion is the fastest growing crime in the United States and much of the world. Its impact is felt from the individual citizen whose identity is stolen to the large private and government entities that have seen their confidential information seriously compromised. It is also a major threat to our national security. As the use of modern communications and technology has moved forward at unparalleled speed the necessary defenses have lagged behind. The President-elect recognizes that this needs immediate attention and input from private sector leaders to help the government plan to make us more secure. r. Giuliani was asked to initiate this process because of his long and very successful government career in law enforcement and his now sixteen years of work providing security solutions in the private sector. Mr. Giuliani is the chairman of the global cyber security practice at Greenberg Traurig and the Chairman and CEO of Giuliani Partners, an international security consulting firm.;photo;4753;17-01-01

Dr. Shulkin has exemplified strong leadership in this position and in various other roles throughout his career, including as a chief executive and a doctor in academia and leader in entrepreneurial roles. “I have no doubt Dr. Shulkin will be able to lead the turnaround our Department of Veterans Affairs needs. His sole mandate will be to serve our veterans and restore the level of care we owe to our brave men and women in the military,” said President-elect Donald J. Trump. “Sadly our great veterans have not gotten the level of care they deserve, but Dr. Shulkin has the experience and the vision to ensure we will meet the healthcare needs of every veteran. Dr. Shulkin is an incredibly gifted doctor who is using his elite talents for medicine to care for our heroes, and Americans can have faith he will get the job done right.” “It is my honor to serve as President-elect Trump’s Secretary of Veterans Affairs,” said Dr. David Shulkin. """"President-elect Trump's commitment to caring for our veterans is unquestionable, and he is eager to support the best practices for care and provide our Veterans Affairs’ teams with the resources they need to improve health outcomes. We are both eager to begin reforming the areas in our Veterans Affairs system that need critical attention, and do it in a swift, thoughtful and responsible way.” Before serving as Under Secretary for Health, Dr. Shulkin served in numerous chief executive roles including serving as President at Morristown Medical Center, Goryeb Children’s Hospital, and Atlantic Rehabilitation Institute, and the Atlantic Health System Accountable Care Organization. Dr. Shulkin also previously served as President and CEO of Beth Israel Medical Center in New York City. Dr. Shulkin has held numerous physician leadership roles including the Chief Medical Officer of the University of Pennsylvania Health System, the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Temple University Hospital, and the Medical College of Pennsylvania Hospital. Dr. Shulkin has also held academic positions including the Chairman of Medicine and Vice Dean at Drexel University School of Medicine. As an entrepreneur, Dr. Shulkin founded and served as the Chairman and CEO of DoctorQuality one of the first consumer-oriented sources of information for quality and safety in healthcare.

1542;1;;On November 8th, EVERYTHING changes.  Our movement is about replacing a failed and corrupt political establishment with a new government controlled by you, the American people.  The establishment has trillions of dollars at stake in this election. For those who control the levers of power in Washington and for the global special interests, they partner with these people that don’t have your good in mind. The political establishment that is trying to stop us is the same group responsible for our disastrous trade deals, massive illegal immigration and economic and foreign policies that have bled our country dry.The political establishment has brought about the destruction of our factories and our jobs as they flee to Mexico, China and other countries all around the world. It’s a global power structure that is responsible for the economic decisions that have robbed our working class, stripped our country of its wealth and put that money into the pockets of a handful of large corporations and political entities. The only thing that can stop this corrupt machine is you. The only force strong enough to save our country is us. The only people brave enough to vote out this corrupt establishment is you, the American people.  I’m doing this for the people and the movement and we will take back this country for you and we will Make America Great Again.;video;49210;16-11-01

1663;1;;Here is my statement. I’ve never said I’m a perfect person, nor pretended to be someone that I’m not.  I’ve said and done things I regret, and the words released today on this more than a decade-old video are one of them.  Anyone who knows me, know these words don’t reflect who I am. I said it, it was wrong, and I apologize. I’ve travelled the country talking about change for America. But my travels have also changed me.  I’ve spent time with grieving mothers who’ve lost their children, laid off workers whose jobs have gone to other countries, and people from all walks of life who just want a better future. I have gotten to know the great people of our country, and I’ve been humbled by the faith they’ve placed in me. I pledge to be a better man tomorrow, and will never, ever let you down. Let’s be honest.  We’re living in the real world.  This is nothing more than a distraction from the important issues we are facing today.  We are losing our jobs, we are less safe than we were 8 years ago and Washington is broken. Hillary Clinton, and her kind, have run our country into the ground. I’ve said some foolish things, but there is a big difference between words and actions. Bill Clinton has actually abused women and Hillary has bullied, attacked, shamed and intimidated his victims. We will discuss this more in the coming days. See you at the debate on Sunday.;video;377566;16-10-01

He has been called the Senate's indispensable man and the gold standard. He led the fight against the Gang of Eight, against Obama's trade deal, against Obama's judges, and for American sovereignty. He has stood up to special interests as few have. There is no more respected man in Congress and we are closely aligned on many issues, including trade and illegal immigration, and I am proud to consider Jeff Sessions an advisor, friend and ally.” Mr. Trump and Senator Sessions surprised the massive crowd at the frontrunner’s Alabama rally just days before Super Tuesday Primary contest. Senator Sessions added, “I am thrilled today to offer my endorsement of Donald J. Trump for President. This election is our last chance to save U.S. sovereignty and to end the domination of the political establishment over the interests of working Americans. Trump alone has rejected the donor class, defending America’s jobs and wages from open borders, uncontrolled immigration and the massive Trans-Pacific Partnership that will cede U.S. authority to foreign powers. Trump’s trade and immigration plans will revitalize our shrinking middle class, keeping jobs and wealth and income inside the United States of America. Trump understands that a nation must always place the interests of its own people first.” Senator Sessions continued, “We are nearing fast the point of no return. The people are hurting. Their wages are declining. Their schools are overburdened. Their hospitals are stretched past the breaking point. Crime is up, and community confidence is down. Americans of all backgrounds and ethnicities, immigrant and US-born, are crying out for leadership that puts their needs first, that takes care of those living and dreaming here today, leadership that understands that there is no constituency other than the American constituency. Mr. Trump is that leader. We are witnessing an incredible movement, arising from the people. The events of history have aligned to give the people this fleeting chance to bust up the oligarchy – to take back control from the ‘Masters of the Universe’ return it to the good and decent and patriotic citizens of the United States.”;photo;6719;16-02-01

More importantly, I am very pleased to see the latest polls from Public Policy Polling showing me at a strong number one with 35% in New Hampshire, the Monmouth University poll showing me, again at number one, with 30% in South Carolina and the latest national poll from Gravis where I am again the clear front runner with 40%.

Trump Orders Flags to be flown at Half-Staff at all Trump Properties in Honor of the Five Fallen Soldiers Mr. Trump Takes Action and Shows Commitment to Military and Vets (New York, NY) July 20th, 2015- Today Donald J. Trump has ordered all flags at Trump properties around the country to be flown at half-staff in honor of the five fallen soldiers who were tragically killed in last week's shooting. Mr. Trump has long been a dedicated supporter of our military and our Veterans and if the President won't act, he will. Mr. Trump stated, """"This disgraceful omission is unacceptable and yet another example of our incompetent politicians. It is a simple yet meaningful and important gesture that signifies our respect and recognition for these great soldiers who lost their lives. We must do better for all Americans, especially our military. We must Make America Great Again!"""" In addition to the lowering of the flags, Mr. Trump has established a hotline (855- VETS- 352) and email address (veterans@donaldtrump.com) for Veterans to share their stories about the need to reform our Veterans Administration. If he is elected President he will take care of these and all Veteran complaints very quickly and efficiently like a world-class business man can do, but a politician has no clue."";status;28045;15-07-01"

He is also allowing our military to decrease substantially in size and strength, something which should never be allowed to happen. Furthermore, he was extremely disrespectful to the thousands upon thousands of people, many of whom happen to be his constituents, that came to listen to me speak about illegal immigration in Phoenix last week by calling them """"crazies"""". These were not """"crazies""""---these were great American citizens. I have great respect for all those who serve in our military including those that weren't captured and are also heroes.

2515;1;;Donald J. Trump Response to Huffington Post Mr. Trump is number one in the unimportant Huffington Post poll, along with all other recently released polls including Reuters, FOX, USA Today/Suffolk University and The Economist. Mr. Trump is in first place in Nevada, where he is also number one, by a wide margin, with Hispanics. He is number one in North Carolina and expects to win Iowa and New Hampshire. Mr. Trump singlehandedly raised the issue of illegal immigration and started a national conversation about what has turned out to be one of the most important topics of this election cycle. Likewise, Mr. Trump is the leader on issues such as the terrible United States trade deals, strengthening our military, taking care of our great Vets and the repeal and replacement of Obamacare. If you read previously written Tweets, Mr. Trump has never been a fan of Arianna Huffington or the money-losing Huffington Post. The only clown show in this scenario is the Huffington Post pretending to be a legitimate news source. Mr. Trump is not focused on being covered by a glorified blog. He is focused on Making America Great Again.;status;10654;15-07-01

2545;1;;Our country is in a major crisis of incompetent leadership. We cannot continue to go on with these politicians who do nothing but talk.;status;5883;15-06-01
2546;1;;Mr. Trump believes that Hillary Clinton has lost all credibility when she blames him for the horrible incident in South Carolina. Why would Mrs. Clinton attack Donald Trump for something that he has nothing to do with? Mr. Trump continues to send his prayers and condolences to the people of South Carolina. In light of the tragedy, Mr. Trump also cancelled a sold out campaign event. At this time of national sorrow, a responsible leader should be focused on uniting and healing the country. Mr. Trump believes that Hillary Clinton does not have any credibility when she blames words for violence. This is the same politician who lied to the world after she failed to take proper steps to secure the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi and falsely blamed the radical Islamic attack on a YouTube video. This is the same person who illegally deleted her emails after getting a subpoena from the U.S. Congress. It is totally inappropriate for Mrs. Clinton to exploit this terrible tragedy and use it as an opportunity to attack Donald Trump. She must be nervous about something.;status;6639;15-06-01

2754;1;;DONALD J. TRUMP WINS MAJOR VICTORY OVER N.Y STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ERIC SCHNEIDERMAN  (For Further Information Contact Michael Cohen 212.836.3212 Mcohen@trumporg.com or Jeff Goldman 212.867.4466 x312  jeffgoldman@bbwg.com) The New York State Supreme Court has just issued various rulings which destroy the case brought by New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman against Donald J. Trump’s Trump University.  The three most important causes of actions have been thrown out entirely and the $40M damage claim is now down to a very small amount of money, if any.  The minor remaining portions of the case create a very heavy burden for the Attorney General to win, as his case is based on “inadmissible, unsigned evidence,” according to the Court ruling.  Schneiderman also lost his motion for summary judgment because there was no proof of any fraud whatsoever.  Indeed, the Court called out Schneiderman’s “evidentiary deficiencies.”   Mr. Trump stated “Eric Schneiderman is a total lightweight who is considered by many, including myself, to be the worst Attorney General in the United States.  He spent millions of dollars of taxpayers’ money trying to build his name and reputation on publicity by going after me and now his entire case has been totally decimated. This all for a school that has a 98% approval rating from its students.  The Better Business Bureau has recently given the school an A rating.  In my opinion, he is a corrupt politician.  All you have to do is look at what is taking place with the Moreland Commission, etc.  Because of his frivolous lawsuits, many jobs are leaving New York City and New York State.  As soon as this case is over we will consider re-opening the school to all of our students and hire back the teachers and others, thereby creating lots of jobs for New York.” “The publicity-mad Schneiderman is desperately trying to change his weak and ineffective image with the voters prior to election” continued Mr. Trump. “The State desperately wanted to settle this case with me—I have no interest in settling and most of the case is now won. Almost the entire case has been thrown out and the remainder totally weakened.  The original lawsuit was brought in the names of 10,000 students, almost all of whom signed affidavits praising the school, and is now reduced to less than 1,000 students. While the judge would not allow us to sue, at this time, for malicious prosecution, she stated that we can come back at a later date with this charge—which we will.” The highest fine for operating without a license in the history of New York has only been a few thousand dollars and we will appeal this part of the decision. Sadly, certain newspapers did not cover this victory correctly and only spoke to Schneiderman and his people. The real fact is this has been almost a complete and total victory for Donald Trump and the school.;status;464;14-10-01

During the 3 1/2 years of World War II that started with the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor in December 1941 and ended with the surrender of Germany and Japan in 1945, the U.S. produced 22 aircraft carriers, 8 battleships, 48 cruisers, 349 destroyers, 420 destroyer escorts, 203 submarines, 34 million tons of merchant ships, 100,000 fighter aircraft, 98,000 bombers, 24,000 transport aircraft, 58,000 training aircraft, 93,000 tanks, 257,000 artillery pieces, 105,000 mortars, 3,000,000 machine guns, and 2,500,000 military trucks. We put 16.1 million men in uniform in the various armed services, invaded Africa, invaded Sicily and Italy, won the battle for the Atlantic, planned and executed D-Day, marched across the Pacific and Europe, developed the atomic bomb and ultimately conquered Japan and Germany.
