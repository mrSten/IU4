One by one, we are checking off the promises we made to the people of the United States. And we will not stop until the job is done.✔️We will reduce taxes.✔️We will cut regulations.✔️We will support our police.✔️We will defend our flag.✔️We will rebuild our military.✔️We will take care of our Veterans.✔️We will fix our trade deals.✔️We will cut wasteful spending.✔️We will promote our values.✔️We will rebuild our inner cities.✔️And we will bring back our jobs and our dreams.The forgotten men and women of America will be forgotten no longer. That is the heart of this new movement – and the future of the Republican Party. The GOP will be the party of the American Worker. We will not answer to donors or lobbyists or special interests – but we will serve the citizens of the United States of America. Global cooperation is important.  But there is no such thing as a global anthem, a global currency, or a global flag. There is one allegiance that unites us all, and that is our allegiance to America. No matter our background, or income, or geography – we are all citizens of this blessed land. And no matter our color, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots. We all salute the same American Flag. And we are all made equal by the same Almighty God. As long as we have faith in each other, and trust in God, then there is no goal beyond our reach. There is no dream too large, no task too great. We are Americans.  And the future belongs to us. The future belongs to all of you. And America is about to come roaring back – Bigger and Better and Stronger than ever before.

As part of my pledge to restore safety for the American People, I have also directed the Defense Community to develop a plan to destroy ISIS. Working with our allies, we will eradicate this evil from the face of the Earth. At the same time, we understand that national security begins with border security.  Foreign terrorists will not be able to strike America if they cannot get into America. So let me state this as clearly as I can: we are going to keep Radical Islamic Terrorists out of our country. We will not be deterred from this course. And, in a matter of days, we will be taking brand new action to protect our people and keep America Safe. I will never, ever apologize for protecting the safety and security of the American People.";photo;7234;2017-02-24T16:44:20+0000

92;1;Timeline Photos;"Joint Statement from President Donald J. Trump and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau President Donald J. Trump and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau held their first official meeting today in Washington, D.C. and affirmed their longstanding commitment to close cooperation in addressing both the challenges facing our two countries and problems around the world. No two countries share deeper or broader relations than Canada and the United States.  We are bound together by our history, our values, our economy, our environment, and our resolve to improve the lives of our citizens.  Our close relationship and ongoing collaboration allow us to successfully meet any challenges we may face over the coming years, and to build a prosperous future for the people of both countries. Neighbors in Growing our Economies We recognize our profound shared economic interests, and will work tirelessly to provide growth and jobs for both countries.  Canada is the most important foreign market for thirty-five U.S. States, and more than $2 billion in two-way trade flows across our shared border every day.  Millions of American and Canadian middle-class jobs, including in the manufacturing sector, depend on our partnership.  We affirm the importance of building on this existing strong foundation for trade and investment and further deepening our relationship, with the common goal of strengthening the middle class. The United States and Canada also recognize the importance of cooperation to promote economic growth, provide benefits to our consumers and businesses, and advance free and fair trade.  We will continue our dialogue on regulatory issues and pursue shared regulatory outcomes that are business-friendly, reduce costs, and increase economic efficiency without compromising health, safety, and environmental standards.  We will work together regarding labor mobility in various economic sectors. Given our shared focus on infrastructure investments, we will encourage opportunities for companies in both countries to create jobs through those investments.  In particular, we look forward to the expeditious completion of the Gordie Howe International Bridge, which will serve as a vital economic link between our two countries. Energy Security and Environment U.S.-Canada energy and environmental cooperation are inextricably linked, and we commit to further improving our ties in those areas.  We have built the world’s largest energy trading relationship.  We share the goals of energy security, a robust and secure energy grid, and a strong and resilient energy infrastructure that contributes to energy efficiency in both countries.  We collaborate closely on energy innovation, particularly in the clean energy sphere.  As the process continues for the Keystone XL pipeline, we remain committed to moving forward on energy infrastructure projects that will create jobs while respecting the environment. We also look forward to building on our many areas of environmental cooperation, particularly along our border and at the Great Lakes, and we will continue to work together to enhance the quality of our air and water. Partners in Keeping our Border Secure We recognize the security of our borders as a top priority.  Together, we address security at our shared border and throughout our two countries, while expediting legitimate and vital cross-border trade and travel.  We demonstrate daily that security and efficiency go hand-in-hand, and we are building a 21st century border through initiatives such as pre-clearance of people and integrated cross-border law enforcement operations.  In addition, our two countries are committed to a coordinated entry-exit information system so that records of land and air entries into one country establish exit records for the other. Recognizing the success of pre-clearance operations for travelers, we commit to establishing pre-clearance operations for cargo.  We intend to accelerate the completion of pre-clearance for additional cities and continue to expand this program. Not only will these efforts enhance efficiency at our shared border, they will also strengthen our shared security.  In the spirit of a more efficient and secure border, we will also examine ways to further integrate our border operations, including analysis of the feasibility of co-locating border officials in common processing facilities. Because we share a strong concern about the increase in opioid-related deaths, our countries will work together on common solutions to protect our people from opioid trafficking. Given the integrated nature of the infrastructure that supports our intertwined economies, cyber threats to either country can affect the other.  We therefore commit to further cooperation to enhance critical infrastructure security, cyber incident management, public awareness, private sector engagement, and capacity building initiatives. Allies in the World We are indispensable allies in the defense of North America and other parts of the world, through NATO and other multilateral efforts.  Our troops have time and again fought together and sacrificed their lives for our shared values.  The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) illustrates the strength of our mutual commitment.  United States and Canadian forces jointly conduct aerospace warning, aerospace control, and maritime warning in defense of North America.  We will work to modernize and broaden our NORAD Partnership in these key domains, as well as in cyber and space. The United States welcomes Canada’s recently announced decision to launch an open and transparent competition to replace its legacy fleet of CF-18 fighter aircraft.  The United States also welcomes Canada’s decision to explore the immediate acquisition of 18 new Super Hornet aircraft as an interim capability to supplement the CF-18s until the permanent replacement is ready.  Canada appreciates the cooperation of the United States to facilitate these processes. The United States values Canada’s military contributions, including in the Global Coalition to Counter-ISIS and in Latvia.  Together, we are harnessing all elements of national power to achieve the goal of degrading and destroying ISIS through our military operations to deny it safe havens and to build the capacity of local partners, stop the flow of foreign terrorist fighters into the Middle East region, cut off access to financing and funding, counter the ISIS narrative, and support the stabilization of communities liberated from ISIS. Empowering Women Entrepreneurs and Business Leaders It is a priority of both countries to ensure equal opportunities for women in the workforce.  We are committed to removing barriers to women’s participation in the business community and supporting women as they advance through it.  As part of this effort, we are creating a United States-Canada Council for Advancement of Women Entrepreneurs and Business Leaders.  We expect this initiative to promote the growth of women-owned enterprises and to further contribute to our overall economic growth and competitiveness, as well as the enhanced integration of our economies. The Way Forward We share a commitment to continue to strengthen our ties for the benefit of our mutual prosperity and security. We look forward to our cabinets following up on today’s meeting with further discussions in their respective areas of responsibility.  Our countries deserve our full commitment to increased economic growth, which we will deliver.  The partnership between the United States and Canada will continue to be unique and a model for the world.";photo;2750;2017-02-13T21:59:29+0000

The recent ballistic missile launch is also in defiance of UN Security Council Resolution 2231, which calls upon Iran “not to undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons, including launches using such ballistic missile technology. These are just the latest of a series of incidents in the past six months in which Houthi forces that Iran has trained and armed have struck Emirati and Saudi vessels, and threatened U.S. and allied vessels transiting the Red Sea.  In these and other similar activities, Iran continues to threaten U.S. friends and allies in the region. The Obama Administration failed to respond adequately to Tehran’s malign actions—including weapons transfers, support for terrorism, and other violations of international norms.  The Trump Administration condemns such actions by Iran that undermine security, prosperity, and stability throughout and beyond the Middle East and place American lives at risk. President Trump has severely criticized the various agreements reached between Iran and the Obama Administration, as well as the United Nations – as being weak and ineffective. Instead of being thankful to the United States for these agreements, Iran is now feeling emboldened. As of today, we are officially putting Iran on notice.";status;18777;2017-02-01T19:37:42+0000

182;1;Timeline Photos;"President Donald J. Trump Nominates Judge Neil Gorsuch to the United States Supreme Court Today, President Donald J. Trump nominated Judge Neil Gorsuch of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit to fill the Supreme Court vacancy created by the passing of Justice Antonin Scalia. The nomination of Judge Gorsuch comes after a selection process marked by an unprecedented level of transparency and involvement by the American voters. “I am proud to announce the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch for Justice of the Supreme Court,” President Trump said. “This has been the most transparent and most important Supreme Court selection process in the history of our country and I wanted the American people to have a voice in this nomination. Judge Gorsuch has a superb intellect, an unparalleled legal education, and a commitment to interpreting the Constitution according to its text. He will make an incredible Justice as soon as the Senate confirms him.” Judge Gorsuch was born and raised in Colorado. He attended Columbia University and Harvard Law School. After graduating with honors, he received his doctorate from Oxford University as a Marshall Scholar. Judge Gorsuch clerked for Judge David Sentelle of the D.C. Circuit and both Justices Byron White and Anthony Kennedy on the Supreme Court. Following a successful career in private practice, Judge Gorsuch joined the Department of Justice as the Principal Deputy Associate Attorney General. In 2006, President George W. Bush nominated him for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, and he was confirmed by voice vote without objection. He has served with distinction, earning a reputation as a brilliant jurist with an outstanding intellect and a clear, incisive writing style, and he is universally respected for his integrity and fairness to all parties. “I am honored and humbled to receive this nomination,” said Judge Gorsuch. “I look forward to meeting with Senators over the coming weeks as we begin this process.”";photo;4003;2017-02-01T04:05:05+0000

We have no choice. For Medicare, for Medicaid, we have to get the prices way down, so that's what we're going to be talking about. We're also going to be streamlining the process so that from your standpoint when you have drug you can actually get it approved, if it works instead of waiting for many, many years. The U.S. drug companies have produced extraordinary results for our country but the pricing has been astronomical for our country.”President Trump Focused On Cutting Regulations To Encourage Drug Companies To Bring Back Operations And Jobs To The United States PRESIDENT TRUMP: “So you have to get your companies back here. We have to make progress back. We're going to get rid of a tremendous number of regulations. I know you have some problems where you cannot even think about opening up new plants and then you can't get approval for the plant and then you can't get approval to make the drug.” President Trump On Appointing A Leader To Streamline The FDA To Reduce Prices And Get New Products On The Market Faster: PRESIDENT TRUMP: “We’re going to streamline the FDA, we have a fantastic person that I think I we’ll be naming fairly soon, he's going to streamline the FDA and you're going to get your products either approved or not approved but it's going to be a quick process. It’s not going to take 15 years. And we're going to do I think a tremendous -- I think we're going to make a tremendous difference to you. I read where it costs sometimes $2.5 billion on average, actually, to come up with a new product. Is that correct? 15 years, $2.5 billion to come up with a product where there's not even a safety problem. So it's crazy.

I expressed to the executives that I want them to move their companies back to the United States -- and I want them to manufacture in the United States. Our trade policy will prioritize that foreign countries pay their fair share for U.S.-manufactured drugs, so our drug companies have greater financial resources to accelerate development of new cures -- I think that’s so important! Right now it’s very unfair what other countries are doing to us - and in order to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN -- we all need to work together right here in the United States of America.";photo;32622;2017-01-31T18:54:22+0000

193;1;;"Statement on the Appointment of Dana Boente as Acting Attorney General The acting Attorney General, Sally Yates, has betrayed the Department of Justice by refusing to enforce a legal order designed to protect the citizens of the United States. This order was approved as to form and legality by the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel. Ms. Yates is an Obama Administration appointee who is weak on borders and very weak on illegal immigration. It is time to get serious about protecting our country. Calling for tougher vetting for individuals travelling from seven dangerous places is not extreme. It is reasonable and necessary to protect our country. Tonight, President Trump relieved Ms. Yates of her duties and subsequently named Dana Boente, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, to serve as Acting Attorney General until Senator Jeff Sessions is finally confirmed by the Senate, where he is being wrongly held up by Democrat senators for strictly political reasons. “I am honored to serve President Trump in this role until Senator Sessions is confirmed.

America has always been the land of the free and home of the brave. We will keep it free and keep it safe, as the media knows, but refuses to say. My policy is similar to what President Obama did in 2011 when he banned visas for refugees from Iraq for six months. The seven countries named in the Executive Order are the same countries previously identified by the Obama administration as sources of terror. To be clear, this is not a Muslim ban, as the media is falsely reporting. This is not about religion - this is about terror and keeping our country safe. There are over 40 different countries worldwide that are majority Muslim that are not affected by this order. We will again be issuing visas to all countries once we are sure we have reviewed and implemented the most secure policies over the next 90 days. I have tremendous feeling for the people involved in this horrific humanitarian crisis in Syria. My first priority will always be to protect and serve our country, but as President I will find ways to help all those who are suffering.”";status;269561;2017-01-29T23:16:28+0000

In this vein, the leaders recognized that NATO must be capable of confronting 21st century threats and that our common defense requires appropriate investment in military capabilities to ensure all Allies are contributing their fair share to our collective security. The leaders agreed on the need to strengthen already robust cooperation in the fight against terrorism and violent extremism, and to work to stabilize conflict areas in the Middle East and North Africa.
